        <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        On this site you will be able to see packages, prices, gallery, 
        About us, and Why get your vehicle detailed? Under packages you will be able to see what is 
        included and the steps I take to achieve that goal. I also have a gallery page where you can 
        see the before and after of vehicles I have worked on. Also, I would like to have a way to 
        book appointments online.
